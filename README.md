# Hi there, I'm Batuhan 👋

### Pro-active Android Developer | Architecture Enthusiast | Full-Stack Explorer

I am an Android Developer with over 3 years of experience, transitioning from the roots of **Java** to the modern, declarative world of **Jetpack Compose**. I don't just write code; I build scalable, maintainable systems using industry-standard architectures.

### 🛠 Technical Expertise

- **Mobile Core:** Kotlin & Java Specialist.
- **Modern UI:** Advanced **Jetpack Compose** & Material Design 3 implementation.
- **Architecture:** Strong focus on **MVVM** and **Clean Architecture**. Recently specialized in **Domain-Based Layering** (UseCases, Domain Models, and Core modules) for maximum decoupling.
- **Dependency Injection:** Expert in **Hilt & Dagger**—transforming complex dependency graphs into clean, injectable code.
- **Data Management:** - **Local Persistence:** Room DB & DataStore (for lightweight preferences).
  - **Remote:** Retrofit & OkHttp for RESTful API integration.
  - **Offline-First:** Mastering the "Local + Remote" synchronization pattern.
- **Firebase Ecosystem:** Deep experience in leveraging the full Firebase suite (Auth, Firestore, Messaging, etc.) as a robust backend solution.

### 🚀 Beyond the Code

- **Backend Awareness:** Comfortable working with **Go (Golang)** and **Node.js**, giving me a unique perspective on end-to-end data flow.
- **App Lifecycle & UX:** Experienced in handling complex asynchronous operations (Coroutines/Flow) to keep UIs responsive during media playback or heavy backend processing.
- **Store Management:** Full mastery of the **Google Play Console**—from internal testing tracks to production release management.
- **Infrastructure:** Capable of self-hosting services (e.g., Jitsi Meet) and building web landing pages to support mobile ecosystems.
